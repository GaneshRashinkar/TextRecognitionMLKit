        Hi, I first want to thank you for installing my application.
        I have created this app to demonstrate how text recognition works.
        In this app you have to enter any text to count and click image of paragraph or any text.
        this app will count that text in image for you. This is just demo of what text recognition do.
        We can used this feature for many kind of tasks. Following are example
        1. In banking application you can process checkbook and other kind of forms.
        2. I have implemented this feature in engine manufacturing plant to match engine number with QR Code of that engine.
        3. You can use text recognition to process scanned documents.
